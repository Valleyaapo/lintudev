## 2024-05-22 - Static Data Image Optimization in Astro\n**Learning:** Static data files (like `projects.ts`) referencing local images must import them as modules (e.g., `import hero from './hero.jpg'`) rather than using string paths to leverage Astro's build-time image optimization. String paths bypass the asset pipeline unless manually processed.\n**Action:** When migrating data-driven components to `astro:assets`, convert string paths in data files to imports and update interfaces to use `ImageMetadata`.
