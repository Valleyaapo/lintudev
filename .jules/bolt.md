## 2026-02-09 - Image Optimization with Astro Assets\n**Learning:** Moving static images from `public/` to `src/assets/` and using `<Image />` component with `sharp` resulted in a ~90% reduction in image size (e.g., 732KB -> 53KB) and automatic format conversion to WebP/AVIF.\n**Action:** Always prefer `src/assets/` for static images over `public/` to leverage build-time optimization, especially when using `@astrojs/vercel` with static output.
